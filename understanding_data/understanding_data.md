# Understanding data

"There are 3 kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."

- Mark Twain, 1906

My sister manages a group of data scientists for a living, despite not being a data scientist herself. She tells me, however, over a few glasses of wine and a half-eaten pizza that even though she's doesn't atcually work with the data for a living she often finds herself in the firing line of why statistical models doesn't always do what the company wants them to do. 

She says to me: "It's like, you know, if you *really* wanted to you can prove that 2 + 2 = 5. If you wanted to!"

And while I appreciate the fevour (and the frustation that comes with dealing a plethora of different models and different outcomes), I had to point out that her analogy was not quite accurate. So we came up with another one together. 

Imagine data as an ocean
